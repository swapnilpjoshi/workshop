msgid "The `UN OpenGIS initiative <http://unopengis.org/unopengis/main/main.php>`__ along with `OSGeo Foundation <https://www.osgeo.org/>`__ organized the `OSGeo UN Committee Educational Challenge <https://www.osgeo.org/foundation-news/2021-osgeo-un-committee-educational-challenge>`__ where Challenge 2 was to create Workshop material for pgRouting. The challenge supports the objectives of the OSGeo UN Committee, i.e. promoting the development and use of open-source software that meets UN needs and supports the aims of the UN. pgRouting is not only useful for routing cars on roads but it can also be used to analyse water distribution networks, river flow or the connectivity of an electricity network. Currently, this workshop expands the pgRouting workshop  by addressing three of the seventeen SDGs"
