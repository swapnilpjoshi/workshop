msgid "SDG 11 aspires to make cities inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable.The world is becoming increasingly urbanized. Since 2007, more than half the worldâ€™s population has been living in cities. This makes it very important for the cities to remain alert when there is a chance of disaster like floods. Local administration should know if their city is goiung to get affected by the rains which happen in their proximity. This excercise will solve one of such problems."
